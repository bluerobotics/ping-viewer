![Replay Data](images/viewer/replay-data.png)

The data from the Ping device is saved to a [log file](logging-and-user-files.md#sensor-logs). The data in these log files can be played back by the Ping Viewer application, and the result is that the data is displayed just the same as it was originally captured.

## Enable Replay Menu

The replay menu is hidden and disabled by default. Visit the [Display Settings](display-settings.md) to enable the Replay Menu.

## Menu Items
