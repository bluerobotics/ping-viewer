## Notifications

When notifications are available, you can display them by clicking on the bell icon in the bottom right hand corner of the Ping Viewer application window. To dismiss a single notification, click the <img src="/ping-viewer/images/icons/close.png" style="display: inline;"/> icon on the notification. To dismiss all notifications, click the <img src="/ping-viewer/images/icons/clear.png" style="display: inline;"/> icon at the bottom of the notification list.

## Application Updates

When the Ping Viewer application opens, it checks for application updates (requires an internet connection). If there is an update available, a notification will be displayed. To update the application, follow the [installation instructions](index.md#installing-and-running-the-application).

## Firmware Updates

After a device is connected, the Ping Viewer application checks if there is a newer firmware version available (requires an internet connection). If there is an update available, a notification will be displayed. To update the firmware, right click on the webpage and click 'save as'. Visit the [Firmware Update](firmware-update.md) menu and select the firmware file that you saved to update the device.
