     * The Set IP Address message is sent by the computer to the sonar as a broadcast
     * message to IP address 255.255.255.255 using port 30303. The sonar responds with a
     * Discovery Response message.
     * By default a new sonar that has been freshly programmed will start with DHCP
     * enabled and will attempt to obtain a leased IP address from a server such as a router
     * on the network. If there is no server on the network, i.e., the sonar is directly
     * connected to a PC then the sonar will try and serve an automatic IP address to the PC
     * using the 169.254.nnn.nnn address range.
     * The Set IP Address command can be used to modify this behaviour by forcing the
     * sonar to stay at a specific IP address. The IP address is stored by the sonar
     * in nonvolatile memory and so once set the sonar will stay at this fixed IP address and will no
     * longer use DHCP to request an address from a server. To remove the fixed IP address
     * and re-enable the default DHCP/AutoIP mode it is necessary to send the Set IP
     * Address command with an address of 0.0.0.0
     * Note that if the reset IP address of 0.0.0.0 is sent then the sonar will not respond with
     * any message as it forces the sonar to execute a warm boot to re-enable DHCP/AutoIP.
     * To verify the IP address has been reset it would be necessary to wait for the sonar to
     * re-boot for at least 5 seconds and then send a Discovery Message.
